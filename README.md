### What is this?
This project makes use of vanilla javascript to build a basic to-do list app with local storage capabilities so the user can retrieve stored lists even if the browser window is refreshed or closed. It is a direct implementation of the code by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media on YouTube.

### What can it do?:
* Add Items
* Delete Items with delete confirmation
* Search Items
* Local Storage capability

### Why was this created?
I created this project as a refresher for anyone who wants to learn to use Javascript before diving into any of the related frameworks.
